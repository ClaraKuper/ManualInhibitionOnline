Experimental code for a manual reaching paradigm
Clara Kuper 
February 2021 

In this experiment, the participant is prompted to reach and touch a point (target) appearing left or right from fixation as quickly as possible. 
At some point after the target appeared, a bright flash can appear on the upper and lower half of the screen. The participant is prompted to ignore that flash.
Together with the flash, the target sometimes jumps to a new location on the screen. If that happens, the observer should still try to touch the target as acurately as possible.
There are trials with a flash, but without jumps, with jumps, but without flash etc.

The experiment is designed to run on jatos https://www.jatos.org/
And is implemented with javascript and jspsych

The jspsych library needs to be included in the experiment folder before uploading it to jatos.
